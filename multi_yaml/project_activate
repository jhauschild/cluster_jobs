# Essentially, this is a poor-man's version of [python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and/or `module load ...` environements available on many clusters.
# Depending on your cluster setup, one of those solutions might be better suited for your case.
#
# To use it, source this file form the command line with `. project_activate` or equivalently `source project_activate` from the terminal. 
# Anything within that terminal will then have the environment variables below set.


# set the base path to the project
export PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/path/to/project"

# this allows to directly call `cluster_jobs.py submit ...` even from other directories
export PATH="$PROJECT_DIR:$PATH"

# if needed, adjust more, e.g.
# export PATH="/mount/packs/intelpython3/bin:$PYTHONPATH"
# export PYTHONPATH="$PROJECT_DIR/TeNPy:$PYTHONPATH"
